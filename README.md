These files allow two of Adafruit's rugged blue push button devices:
 - momentary pushbutton
 - on/off switch
to reboot or shutdown a Raspberry Pi

Use the next guisde and not this one. The complete momentary project is described here https://sites.google.com/site/cartwrightraspberrypiprojects/home/steps/momentary-reset-switch_1

The on/off switch is described here: https://sites.google.com/site/cartwrightraspberrypiprojects/home/home-automation-categories/lighting/pushbutton-reset-switch
